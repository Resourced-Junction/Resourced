# Problems

- Where to store the files? Persistors (through stream or http endpoint) or ipfs
- Will every persistor store every file (or url)?
- Will files (or urls) be requested or sent out at periodically by persistors?
- Will every node repeat (periodically or when requested) all or specific files (or urls) at the same time (creating a lot of redundant traffic)?
- How will compensation of initial publishers work?
